# Hill-Cipher
(Summer 2020)<br>This project is a program that encrypts the alphabetic letters in a file using the Hill Cipher, where the Hill Matrix can be any size from 2x2 up to 9x9. The program takes two command line parameters containing the names of the file storing the encryption key and the file to be encrypted.
